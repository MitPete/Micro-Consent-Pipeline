## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features (if used)
- **`feature/*`** - New features (`feature/add-oauth-support`)
- **`fix/*`** - Bug fixes (`fix/memory-leak-parser`)

### Pull Request Process

1. **Target the correct branch** (usually `main`)
2. **Use descriptive titles** following conventional commits
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Ensure CI passes** (all tests, linting, security checks)
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** promptly and thoughtfully
7. **Squash commits** if requested by maintainers

### Review Process

- **Initial review** within 48 hours (goal)
- **Feedback** provided constructively and clearly
- **Approval required** from at least one maintainer
- **Automated checks** must pass (CI, security, formatting)

## Repository Secrets (CI / Release)

For CI jobs that build and publish container images or push artifacts, please ensure the following repository secrets are configured in GitHub (Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions):

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` ‚Äî Docker Hub username (if using Docker Hub)
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` ‚Äî Docker Hub access token/password (keep this secret)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` ‚Äî Provided automatically by Actions but may need additional permissions for external registries

If you use GitHub Packages instead of Docker Hub, you can rely on the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` and adjust the workflows accordingly. Keep these secrets up-to-date and restricted to maintainers only.
